[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vbmtwe55m4m1dlw4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/IForgeDe/penshell)

Penshell is a experimental command line pipeline with scrippting support written in pure dotnet.
Its is for developing short Tasks via a simple command line interface and chaining them to a complex scripting process.
The command assemblies of this project are reusable in applications
based on the [CliFx](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliFx) project.
The PenshellCLI is for collecting, managing and enhancing the functionality for scripting.

## Why Penshell

The intention of this project was initially to automate recurring processes of all kind in an easy way.
The result of this idea is a project to design simple commands in a
script pipeline, which is easy to understand, write, manage and test.

## How should a command looks like?
